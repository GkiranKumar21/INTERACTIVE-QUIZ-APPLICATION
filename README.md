#Description About The Quiz-App : 

üß† Quiz Application :

This is a fully functional, responsive Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with an engaging and interactive way to test their knowledge across a set of multiple-choice questions. With a sleek UI, a countdown timer, dynamic feedback, score tracking, and a restart feature, this quiz app showcases clean design principles and JavaScript interactivity suited for beginner to intermediate developers.

üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Multiple Choice Questions
Each quiz question offers four options. Users can select the one they believe is correct. Once an option is selected or time runs out, the app highlights the correct and incorrect answers in distinct colors for clarity.

‚è± Countdown Timer with Visual Progress Bar
Each question comes with a 30-second countdown. A progress bar visualizes the remaining time, changing color (from blue to red) when time is critical (10 seconds or less). This keeps the quiz engaging and adds a layer of urgency.

core Tracking
The application maintains a running score displayed at the top of the quiz container. Every correct answer increments the score, giving users instant feedback on their performance.

üß† Instant Feedback
Users receive immediate feedback after selecting an option or when time expires. The feedback text is color-coded (green for correct, red for incorrect) and provides clarity on the correct answer if the user's choice was incorrect or not made in time.

üîÅ Restart Capability
After the final question, the app presents a summary of the user's score out of the total number of questions. A "Restart Quiz" button allows users to reset the state and try again from the beginning.

üß± Clean UI & Responsive Design
The app features a modern, minimalist design using soft colors and rounded elements to create a user-friendly interface. The design adapts smoothly to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops alike.

üí° How It Works

Timer: A 30-second countdown starts. The progress bar shrinks as time elapses.

Selecting an option immediately stops the timer and locks in the choice.

The app shows whether the choice was correct or not, and displays feedback accordingly.

Advancing: Users click "Next" to proceed to the following question.

Completion: Once all questions are answered, the final score is shown, and users can restart the quiz if they wish.

üì± Responsive Design
